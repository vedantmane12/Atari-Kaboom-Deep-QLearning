## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct specifically applies to:
- GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation and wiki contributions
- Conference presentations or academic publications related to this work
- Educational use of this project in classroom settings
- Any public communication about this project

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Academic and Educational Context

Given the educational nature of this project, we especially encourage:

### For Students and Learners
- Ask questions respectfully and provide context for your learning level
- Share your learning journey and challenges to help others
- Acknowledge when you're building upon or learning from others' work
- Be patient with different learning paces and backgrounds

### for Educators and Researchers
- Provide constructive and educational feedback
- Share knowledge generously while respecting intellectual property
- Mentor newcomers to the field with patience and encouragement
- Model best practices in research methodology and scientific communication

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the project maintainers immediately by contacting:

- **Primary Contact**: [Your Email/Contact Information]
- **Alternative Contact**: [Alternative Contact if applicable]
- **Anonymous Reporting**: [If you have an anonymous reporting system]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
